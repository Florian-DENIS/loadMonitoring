# loadMonitoring

Welcome to my loadMonitoring project repository. This application, built using R and the Shiny package, serves as a tool to monitor the training load of athletes based on session data collected. It could help coaches and athletes to make informed decisions about workout intensity and recovery.

## Features

- **Input Parameters:**
  - Date of the session
  - Duration of the session
  - Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) of the athlete
  - Type of session (e.g., on the pitch, in the gym, running, etc.)

- **Data Collection:**
  - The application requires a file containing session data with the specified parameters.

- **Monitoring:**
  - Once the data is loaded, the application visualizes and analyzes the training load over time.
